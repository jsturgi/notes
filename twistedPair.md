### Summary
A type of wiring in which two conductors are twisted together to cancel out EMI and cross talk.  Divided into categories: [Cat Cables](catCables.md)

### Types of Twisted Pair Cables
#  Unshielded Twisted Pair(UTP)
- **Description**: Consists of pairs of wires twisted  together without additional shielding
- **Common Uses**: Ethernet networks, telephone lines
- **Advantages**: Cost-effective, easy to install, flexible
- **Disadvantages**: More susceptible to EMI compared to shielded cables

# Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
- **Description**: Similar to UTP but includes additional shielding to protect against EMI.
- **Common Uses**: Environments with high EMI, industrial settings.
- **Advantages**: Better protection against EMI, reduced crosstalk.
- **Disadvantages**: More expensive, less flexible, harder to install.

### Purposes
- **Networking**: Used in Ethernet networks for data transmission
- **Telecommunications**: Used in telephone lines and other communication systems
- **Data Centers**: Higher cat cables like Cat6a, Cat7, and Cat8 are used in data centers for high-speed data transfer
