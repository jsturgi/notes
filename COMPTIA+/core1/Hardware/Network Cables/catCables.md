### Summary
A type of twisted pair cable used for Ethernet and other  network physical layers.

### Common Types of Cat Tables
## Cat 5
- **Connector:** RJ45
- **Features:** Supports up to 100 Mbps, 100 MHz frequency
- **Purpose:** Suitable for basic ethernet networks, telephone, and video

## Cat 5e
- **Connector:** RJ45
- **Features:** Supports up to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps), 100 MHz frequency. reduced cross talk
- **Purpose:** Used in residential and commercial networks for gigabit ethernet

## Cat 6
- **Connector:** RJ45
- **Features:** Supports up to 10 Gbps speeds and 250 Mhz. Better insulation and reduced crosstalk compared to Cat5e.
- **Purpose:** Suitable for high speed networks, ie gigabit internet and 10 gigabit over shorter distances

## Cat 6a (augmented)
- **Connector:** RJ45
- **Features:** Supports up to 10 Gbps speeds and 500 Mhz frequency. Increased performance over longer distances
- **Purpose:** Suitable for data centers and enterprise networks requiring high-speed data transfer over longer distances

## Cat 7
- **Connector:** GG45 or TERA (backwards compatible with RJ45)
- **Features:** Supports up to 10 Gbps and 600 Mhz. Shielded twisted pairs for reduced interference
- **Purpose:** Used in high-speed networking environments, ie data centers and backbone networks

## Cat 8
- **Connector:** RJ45
- **Features:** Supports up to 40 Gbps and 2000 Mhz. Shielded twisted pairs for max performance
- **Purpose:** Designed for data centers and high performance environments requiring ultra-fast data transfer

| Category | Connector | Max Speed | Max Freq | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Cat 5 | RJ45 | 100 Mbps | 100 Mhz | Basic Ethernet, telephone, video |
| Cat 5e | RJ45 | 1 Gbps | 100 Mhz | Residential and commerical networks |
| Cat6 | RJ45 | 10 Gbps | 250 Mhz | High-speed networks, Gigabit Ethernet |
| Cat6a | RJ45 | 10 Gbps | 500 Mhz | Data centers, enterprise networks |
| Cat 7 | GG45/Tera | 10 Gbps | 600 Mhz | High-speed networking environments |
| Cat 8 | RJ45 | 40 Gbps | 2000 Mhz | Data centers, high-performance computing |

### Connectors
- **RJ45**: The most common connector for Cat cables, used in Ethernet networks
- **GG45**: An updated version of RJ45, used for Cat7 cables
- **TERA**: A specialized connector used for Cat7 cables, offering better performance and shielding

### Features
- **Twisted Pairs**: Pairs of wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference
- **Shielding**: Some cat cables (ie 6a, 7, 8) have additional shielding to further reduce interference and crosstalk
- **Backward Compatibility**: Higher category  cables are often backwards compatible with lower standards

### Purposes
- **Residential**: Cat5e, Cat6
- **Commercial Networks**: Cat6a, Cat7
- **Data Centers**: Cat8
