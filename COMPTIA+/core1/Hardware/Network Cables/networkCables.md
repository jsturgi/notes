## Cables 
| Cable Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Cat5       | Standard Ethernet cable capable of speeds up to 100 Mbps. |
| Cat5e      | Enhanced version of Cat5 cable with improved performance and support for speeds up to 1 Gbps. |
| Cat6       | Cable designed for Gigabit Ethernet networks with speeds up to 10 Gbps. |
| Cat6a      | Augmented version of Cat6 cable with improved performance and support for speeds up to 10 Gbps over longer distances. |
| Coaxial     | Single conductor surrounded by insulating material, which is tghen surrounded by a copper screen, and an outer plastic sheath. Speeds up to 1gbps |
| Shielded Twisted       | Metal shielding over each pair of wires, reducing EMI and possibility of network access. |
| Unshielded Twisted Pair | Copper wires twisted together into pairs throughout entire length of cable. |
| Plenum | Cable with enclosed space for airflow, reducing amount of PVC chemicals released in case of fire. |
| Fiber Optic | Uses thin strands of glass or plastic fibers to transmit data using light signals. |
| T568A/B | Wiring standard for twisted pair network cables, defining the pinout for RJ45 connectors. |
