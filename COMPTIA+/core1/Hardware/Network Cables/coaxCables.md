### Summary
A type of electrical cable consisting of a central conductor, an insulating  layer, a metallic shield, and an outer insulating layer.  Used to transmit high-freq electrical signals with low loss.

### Structure
1. **Central Conductor**: Usually made of copper or aluminum, this is the core that carries the electrical signal.
2. **Insulating Layer**: Surrouinds central conductor, providing insulation to prevent signal loss.
3. **Metallic Shield**: A braided or solid layer of metal that surrounds the insulating layer. It acts as a shield to protect from EMI.
4. **Outer Insulating Layer**: Outer layer made of plastic or rubber, protecting from physical damage.

### Types of Coaxial Cables
- **RG-6**: Used for cable television and internet.  Has a thicker core and better shielding than RG-59.
- **RG-59**: Used for low-freq apps sa analog video and CCTV.  Has a thinner core and less shielding  than RG-6.
- **RG-11**: Used for l ong-distance signal transmission due to its lower attenuation.  Thicker and less flexible than RG-6 and RG-59.

### Features
- **High Bandwidth**: Coax cables can carry a large amount of data, making them suitable for internet and tv signals.
- **Low Signal Loss**: Their design minimizes signal loss over long distances.
- **Shielding**: The metallic shield protects the signal from external electromagnetic interference, ensuring a clear  and stable transmission.

### Purposes
- **Television**: Connect TVs to cable TV services
- **Internet**: Used in broadband internet connections, particulary cable services
- **Radio Communication**: Used in radio transmitters and receivers to connect antennas and other equipment. 
- **CCTV**: Used for video signal transmission

### Connectors
- **F-Type**: Commonly used for cable tv and internet
- **BNC**: Used in professional video and radio frequency applications
- **N-Type**: Used in wireless communcations and high-frequency applications
