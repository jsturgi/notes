## Summary
Plenum cables are a type of electrical cable that is designed to be installed in the plenum spaces of buildings - the areas  used for air circulation for heating, ventilation, HVAC systems. Typically found above drop ceilings or below raised floors.

## Features
- **Fire-Resistant**: Made with special fire-resistant materials that emit low smoke and fewer toxic fumes when exposed to fire.
- **Low Smoke**: The materials used are designed to produce minimal smoke, which is crucial for maintaining air quality and visibiity during a fire.
- **Self-Extinguishing**: These cables will not continue to burn once the source of the fire is removed.

## Common Uses
- **HVAC  Systems**: Used in spaces where air circulation is critical
- **Networking**: Commonly used for network cabling in commerical buildings, especially in areas where fire safety is a concern.
- **Telecommunication**: Used for telphone and data communication lines  in plenum spaces

# Types of Plenum Cables
- **Ethernet Cables**: Cat 58, 6, 6a cables that are specifically designed for use in plenum spaces.
- **Coaxial Cables**: Used for tv and internet connections in plenum spaces
- **Fiber Optic Cables**: Used for high speed data transmission in plenum spaces.
