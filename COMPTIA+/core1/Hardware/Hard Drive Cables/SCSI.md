## Summary
Used to connect and transfer data between computers and peripheral devices such as hard drives, scanners, and printers.  SCSI is a set of standards for connecting and transferring data between computers and peripheral devices.

## Key Features
- **High Speed Data Transfer**: SCSI Cables support high-speed data transfer rates, depending on the SCSI standard.
- **Multiple Devices**: A single SCSI cable can connect multiple devices in a daisy chain configuration, allowing for the connection of up to 16 devices, including the host adapter.
- **Variety of Connectors**: SCSI Cables come with various types of connectors, including 50-pin, 68-pin, and 80-pin connectors, depending on the SCSI standard and devices being connected.
- **Parallel Interface**: Traditional SCSI uses a parallel interface for data transfer, although there are also serial versions like Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)

## Types of Connectors
- **50-pin Centronics**: Commonly used in older  SCSI-1 and -2 devices.
- **68-Pin High-Density (HD68)**: Used in newer  SCSI standards like Ultra SCSI and Ultra2  SCSI
- **80-Pin Single Connector Attachment (SCA)**: Used in hot-swappable devices, typically in server environments.

## Common Uses
- **Hard Drives**: Connecting internal and external hard drives in servers and workstations
- **Scanners**: Connecting high-resolution scanners to computers
- **Printers**: Connecting high-speed printers, particularly in enterprise  environments
- **Tape Drives**: Used in  backup and archival systems

| Ultra SCSI    | Up to 20 MB/s      |
| Ultra2 SCSI   | Up to 40 MB/s      |
| Ultra3 SCSI   | Up to 80 MB/s      |
| Ultra160 SCSI | Up to 160 MB/s     |
| Ultra320 SCSI | Up to 320 MB/s     |
| Ultra640 SCSI | Up to 640 MB/s     |
| SAS           | Up to 12 Gb/s      |
