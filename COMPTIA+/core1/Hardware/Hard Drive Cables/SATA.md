## Summary
Used to connect storage devices such as hard drives, solid-state drives, and optical drives to the motherboard of a computer.  Designed to transmit data at high speeds and are an essential component in modern computer systems.

## Key Features
 - **High Data Transfer Rates**: Supports data transfer rates ranging from 1.5 gbps (SATA I) to 6 gbps (SATA III)
 - **Improved Cable Management**: Thinner and more flexible than the older PATA cables, which helps improve airflow and reduce clutter inside the computer case.
 - **Hot Swapping**: Allows devides to be connected or disconnected without shutting down the system (requires mobo support)
 - **Connector Types**: Typically consists of a 7-pin data connector and a 15-pin power connector.

 ## Types of SATA Cables
 - **SATA Data Cable**: A 7-pin cable used to transmit data between storage device and mobo.
 - **SATA Power Cable**: A  15-pin cable used to supply power to the storage device.

 ##  Common Uses
 - **Hard Drives**: Connecting internal HDDs to the mobo
 - **SSDs**: Connecting internal SSDs for faster data access and improved performance
 - **Optical Drives**: Connecting CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray drives
 - **External Storage**: eSATA (external SATA) cables are used for connecting external storage devices
