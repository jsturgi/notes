## Summary
Used to connect storage devices such as hard drives and optical drives to the motherboard  of a computer.  IDE was a widely used interface standard before being replaced by SATA.  AKA Parallel ATA (PATA)

## Key Features
- **Parallel Data Transfer**: Transmits data in parallel, with multiple bits sent simultaneously across multiple wires.
- **40 or 80 Conductors**: Typically comes in two types: 40 or 80-conductor cables.  40 are used for older devices, 80 for newer, providing better signal integrity
- **40-pin Connector**: Uses a 40-pin connector to connect to the motherboard and the storage devices.
- **Master/Slave Config**: Allows two devices to be connected on a single cable, configured as a master and slave using jumpers on the devices

## Common Uses
- **Hard Drives**: Connecting internal HDDs to the  mobo
- **Optical Drives**: Connecting CD, DVD, and Bluray drives
- **Legacy Systems**: Used in older computer systems that do not support SATA
