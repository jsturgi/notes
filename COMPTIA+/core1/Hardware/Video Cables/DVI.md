## Summary
A video display interface developed to transmit digital video signals from a computer to a display device such as a monitor.  Designed to replace the VGA standard and supports  both digital and analog signals.

## Key Features
- **Digital and Analog Support**: DVI can transmitg both digital (DVI-D) and analog (DVI-A) signals, making it versatile for different types of displays.
- **High-Resolution Support**: Supports resolutions up to 1920x1080 at 60 Hz for single-link DVI and up to 2560x1600 @ 60  Hz for dual-link DVI
- **Multiple Connector Types**: There are several DVI connectors, each with different pin configurations to support their various signal tgypes.

## Types of DVI Connectors
- **DVI-D (Digital Only)**: Transmits only digital signals. Commonly used for connecting digital displays like LCD monitors.
- **DVI-A (Analog Only)**: Transmits only analog signals. rarely used.
- **DVI-I (Integrated)**: Transmits both digital and analog signals. Can be used with both types of displays.
- **Single-Link and Dual-Link**: Single-link DVI supports lower resolutions, while dual-link DVI supports higher resolutions.

## Common Uses
- **Computer Monitors**: Connecting computers to monitors, especially older ones without HDMI or DisplayPort inputs.
- **Projectors**: Used in some p rojectors for high-quality video input.
- **Graphics Cards**: Many older cards include DVI ports for connecting to displays.
