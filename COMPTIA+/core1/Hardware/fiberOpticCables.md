## Summary
A type of network cable that uses  thin strands of glass or plastic fibers to transmit data using light signals.  Designed to provide high-speed and long distance communication with minimal signal loss.

## Structure
1) **Core**: Center of cable, made of glass or plastic that the light signals travel through
2) **Cladding**: A layer of material that surrounds the core and reflects light back into the core, preventing signal loss.
3) **Buffer Coating**: A protective layer surround the cladding to protect from damage and moisture.
4) **Strength Members**: Provide strength and protect the fiber from physical stress (kevlar, aramid yarn)
5) **Outer Jacket**: The outermost layer that protects the cable from environmental damage.

## Types of Fiber Optic Cable
- **Single-Mode  Fiber (SMF)**: Has a small core (9 microns) and is designed for long-distance communication.  It uses a single light path and is typically used in telecommunication and cable tv networks.
- **Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)**: Has a larger core (50-62.5 microns) and is designed for shorter distance communication.  It uses multiple light paths and is commonly used in LANs and data centers.

## Advantages
- **High Bandwidth**: Capable of transmitting large amounts of data at very high speeds.
- **Long Distance**: Can transmit data over long distances without significant signal loss compared to copper cables.
- **Immunity to EMI**: Not affected by emi, making them ideal for environments with high electrical noise.
- **Security**: Difficult to tap into without being detected,  providing a higher level of security for data transmission.

## Common Uses
- **Telecommunications**: Used for long-distance telephone and internet connections
- **Internet**: Backbone of internet infrastructure, providing high-speed data transmission.
- **Cable TV**: Used to deliver high-definition television signals
- **Data Centers**: Used for high-speed data transfer between servers and storage devices
